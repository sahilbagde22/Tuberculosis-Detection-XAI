# Tuberculosis-Detection-XAI
This project implements a deep learning-based Tuberculosis detection model using chest X-ray images, integrated with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Grad-CAM to visualize and interpret model decisions. The aim is to improve diagnostic transparency and trust in AI-powered medical imaging.
